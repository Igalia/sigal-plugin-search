# Search Plugin for Sigal
This plugin provides search capabilities to galleries generated by the [Sigal static generator](http://sigal.saimon.org/en/latest/). It uses [Lunr JS](https://lunrjs.com/) as the search engine.

This plugin is designed to work with the [Colorbox2 theme](https://github.com/Igalia/sigal-theme-colorbox2). If you want to use it with your own theme, just take a look at [this commit](https://github.com/Igalia/sigal-theme-colorbox2/commit/fd62f6db61bb6b996c0e2e1705c9412bcd466bb3).
